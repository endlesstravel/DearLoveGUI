        <member name="M:Love.Imgui.Renderer.BindTexture(Love.Texture)">
            <summary>
            Creates a pointer to a texture, which can be passed through ImGui calls such as <see cref="M:ImGuiNET.ImGui.Image(System.IntPtr,Love.Vector2)" />. That pointer is then used by ImGui to let us know what texture to draw

        <member name="M:Love.Imgui.Renderer.UnbindTexture(System.IntPtr)">
            <summary>
            Removes a previously created texture pointer, releasing its reference and allowing it to be deallocated
